# Express.js

This app will help me take a deeper look into the Express.js framework. I will be looking at the documentation and following along with their tutorials. I will also be looking at other resources to help me understand the framework better.

The documentation can be found here: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html

## Installation

```bash
mkdir my_testing_app
cd my_testing_app
```

The documentation then also says to run the following command:

```bash
npm init -y
```

This command will create a package.json file. This file will contain all the dependencies for the project. The -y flag will skip the prompts and just create the file.
